Tiago Silva's Interview exercise for Hostfully

Hi,
I've tried to show a little of my skills, but due to having some limitations on the technical exercise page (no api available, some issues on creation of computers and some actions), I've decided to implement a little api with an example similar to the one on the exercise.

I've started with an analysis of the computer platform and I've written down all the details about it.
If it was a real product, I'd bring those to discuss with the team and define where the tests would go to with a shifting left approach.

Please have a look at it on the analysis folder.

==

the useful folder contains a little farmer I've made in ruby to get the data and populate the json to the backend, I've included it just in case you're curious.

==

on the useful folder there's also a very simple postman collection u can use to create and check the added api computers similar to what I would expect to have from a real api.

==

finally on the cypress folder you'll have the cypress project, I've implemented all using js and I haven't used cucumber for the extra points.
the api tests require the example server to be running, so please leave this one running when triggering these.

==

I've enjoyed doing the exercise, thank you and hope to hear from you soon.

Best regards,

Tiago
